## Key Concepts Learned
- [List main concepts from lecture]
- [Technical skills covered]

Spatial Machine Learning & Advanced Regression

Converting to Spatial Data
Step 1: Make your data spatial
Step 2: Spatial Join with Neighborhoods

Part 1: Expanding Your Regression Toolkit

Model 1: No Interaction (Parallel Slopes)
Model 2: With Interaction (Different Slopes)

When Not To Use Interactions
Warning

When NOT to Use Interactions:

Small samples: Need sufficient data in each group
Overfitting: Too many interactions make models unstable

Polynomial Regression

Part 2: Creating Spatial Features
Tobler’s First Law of Geography
Three Approaches to Spatial Features
1️⃣ Buffer Aggregation
Count or sum events within a defined distance
Example: Number of crimes within 500 feet
2️⃣ k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
Average distance to k closest events
Example: Average distance to 3 nearest violent crimes
3️⃣ Distance to Specific Points
Straight-line distance to important locations
Example: Distance to downtown, nearest T station

Part 3: Fixed Effects
Categorical variables that capture all unmeasured characteristics of a group
