## Key Concepts Learned
- [List main concepts from lecture]
- [Technical skills covered]
quiz 3 questions
1.Anscombe's Quartet
2.add dataset: left join right join
3.In ggplot2, aes() is short for aesthetic mapping, which is used to specify how variables in the data are mapped to the visual properties of the plot.

1.Plain explanation

aes() = “link the columns in your dataset to the visual appearance of the plot.”

Inside aes(), you usually put column names from your data frame, such as x, y, color, size, shape, etc.

If you want to set a fixed value (e.g., make all points red), you don’t use aes(). Instead, you write it directly in geom_*().

2.add a layer: +
3.geom_point
4.geom_point(alpha= 0.5)

Part 1: Why Spatial Analysis Matters
Part 2: Spatial Data Fundamentals
Vector Data Model
Real world → Simplified geometric representations

Three basic types:

Points → Locations (schools, hospitals, crime incidents)
Lines → Linear features (roads, rivers, transit routes)
Polygons → Areas (census tracts, neighborhoods, service areas)

Part 3: Spatial Operations

spatial join
A note about that (.)

Part 4: Geometry Operations
Buffer Operations

Part 5: Coordinate Reference Systems
step 1: approximate earth's shape
step 2: tie ellipsiod to the real earth
ex: 1866 clarke
step 3: write down lat/long grid

st_crs(tracts)

st_set_crs(tracts)
st_set_crs(): only declares the coordinate reference system, it does not change the coordinate values.
👉 Use this when the original data are already in latitude/longitude (or another CRS), but the CRS information is missing.

st_transform(): actually performs a coordinate transformation, so the coordinate values will change.
👉 Use this when you need to convert WGS84 latitude/longitude into a projected CRS (e.g., UTM).

## Coding Techniques
- [New R functions or approaches]
- [Quarto features learned]
g<-ggplot(data=gcs_data)+aes(x=income,y=%bach ,color=%happy)+geom_points(decorate   colors,sizes)+x_xaxis
