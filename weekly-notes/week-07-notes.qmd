quiz
1. You're analyzing environmental justice...
✅ B) Buffer aggregation (count facilities within X meters)
→ Because environmental exposure is typically measured by how many pollutant sources fall within a fixed distance (e.g., within 1 km) of a tract.

2. Why might a model with neighborhood fixed effects have high in-sample R² (0.88) but worse cross-validated RMSE than expected?
✅ D) The model may be overfitting to neighborhood-specific noise rather than learning generalizable patterns.
→ Fixed effects can capture idiosyncratic variation in each neighborhood, inflating R² but hurting out-of-sample performance.

3. In a model with Age + I(Age²), the coefficient on Age² is positive and significant. What does this suggest?
✅ B) The relationship is U-shaped (decreases then increases).
→ Positive Age² means curvature opens upward; after an initial decline, prices rise again with age.

4. Recommended best practice when categorical variables have very few observations (n < 10) for 10-fold CV:
✅ C) Group small categories into an “Other” or “Small Neighborhoods” category before running CV.
→ Ensures each fold has enough representation and prevents folds without certain categories.

NEW: Spatial diagnostics:

Are errors random or clustered?
Do we predict better in some areas?
Is there remaining spatial structure?
