Graffiti has long been associated with \"broken windows theory\" - the idea that visible signs of disorder in a neighborhood may correlate with more serious crime. By analyzing whether graffiti complaints can help predict where burglaries occur, I test whether this visible indicator of neighborhood conditions has predictive power for property crime.\n\nThis analysis builds a spatial predictive model using 2017 data, validates it through spatial cross-validation, and tests its predictive accuracy on 2018 burglary data. I compare the model's performance against a simple kernel density baseline to determine whether the added complexity of including spatial features provides meaningful improvements in prediction.\n\n## Setup\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load required packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)      # Data manipulation\nlibrary(sf)             # Spatial operations\nlibrary(here)           # Relative file paths\nlibrary(viridis)        # Color scales\nlibrary(terra)          # Raster operations\nlibrary(spdep)          # Spatial dependence\nlibrary(FNN)            # Fast nearest neighbors\nlibrary(MASS)           # Negative binomial regression\nlibrary(patchwork)      # Plot composition\nlibrary(knitr)          # Tables\nlibrary(kableExtra)     # Table formatting\nlibrary(spatstat.geom)  # Spatial geometries\nlibrary(spatstat.explore) # KDE\nlibrary(rlang)          # For dynamic column selection\n\n# Set options\noptions(scipen = 999)\nset.seed(5080)\n\n# Create visualization theme\ntheme_crime <- function(base_size = 11) {\n  theme_void(base_size = base_size) +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = base_size + 1),\n      plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"gray30\", size = base_size - 1),\n      legend.position = \"right\",\n      panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n}\n\ntheme_set(theme_crime())\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Part 1: Data Loading and Exploration\n\n### Load Spatial Boundaries\n\nI load Chicago's spatial boundaries, using police districts for spatial cross-validation and ensuring we test the model on completely held-out geographic areas. All data is transformed to Illinois State Plane East (ESRI:102271) which uses feet as units and minimizes distortion for Chicago's location.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load Chicago boundary\nchicagoBoundary <- \n  st_read(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urbanSpatial/Public-Policy-Analytics-Landing/master/DATA/Chapter5/chicagoBoundary.geojson\") %>%\n  st_transform('ESRI:102271')\n\n# Load police districts\ntmp <- st_read(\"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/geospatial/24zt-jpfn?method=export&format=GeoJSON\") %>%\n  st_transform('ESRI:102271')\n\n# Automatically find the district column name\ndist_col <- names(tmp)[grepl(\"dist\", names(tmp), ignore.case = TRUE)][1]\nif (is.na(dist_col)) stop(\"No district-like column found.\")\n\npoliceDistricts <- tmp %>%\n  dplyr::rename(District = !!sym(dist_col)) %>%\n  dplyr::select(District, geometry)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Police districts loaded:** 23 districts\n\n### Load Burglary Data\n\nBurglaries are the outcome I want to predict. This dataset represents reported property crimes in 2017, which serve as training data. I filter for forcible entry burglaries specifically.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load burglary data from 2017 Chicago crimes dataset\nburglaries <- read_csv(\"data/Crimes_-_2017_20251114.csv\") %>%\n  # Filter for burglary crimes only\n  filter(`Primary Type` == \"BURGLARY\") %>%\n  # Filter for forcible entry\n  filter(str_detect(Description, \"FORCIBLE ENTRY\")) %>%\n  # Remove records with missing or invalid coordinates\n  filter(!is.na(Latitude), !is.na(Longitude)) %>%\n  filter(Latitude > 41.6, Latitude < 42.1) %>%\n  filter(Longitude > -87.95, Longitude < -87.5) %>%\n  # Convert to spatial object\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"Longitude\", \"Latitude\"), crs = 4326) %>%\n  st_transform('ESRI:102271')\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Burglaries loaded:** 8116 forcible entry incidents in 2017\n\n### Visualize Burglary Patterns\n\nUnderstanding the spatial distribution of burglaries is crucial before building any model. I create both a point map and a density surface to identify clustering patterns.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Point map\np1 <- ggplot() + \n  geom_sf(data = chicagoBoundary, fill = \"gray95\", color = \"gray60\") +\n  geom_sf(data = burglaries, color = \"#d62828\", size = 0.1, alpha = 0.4) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Burglary Locations in Chicago (2017)\",\n    subtitle = paste0(\"n = \", nrow(burglaries), \" incidents\")\n  ) +\n  theme_crime()\n\n# Density surface\np2 <- ggplot() + \n  geom_sf(data = chicagoBoundary, fill = \"gray95\", color = \"gray60\") +\n  geom_density_2d_filled(\n    data = data.frame(st_coordinates(burglaries)),\n    aes(X, Y),\n    alpha = 0.7,\n    bins = 8\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(\n    option = \"plasma\",\n    direction = -1,\n    guide = \"none\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Burglary Density Surface\",\n    subtitle = \"Kernel density estimation\"\n  ) +\n  theme_crime()\n\np1 + p2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Assignment4_Spatial_Predictive_Analysis_REVISED_files/figure-html/visualize-burglaries-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Spatial patterns observed:** The maps reveal clear spatial clustering of burglaries. Rather than being evenly distributed across Chicago, burglaries concentrate in specific areas, suggesting that location-based factors influence crime patterns. This spatial structure motivates the use of spatial features in the predictive model.\n\n### Load Graffiti Removal Data\n\nGraffiti removal requests represent the predictor variable - a visible indicator of potential neighborhood disorder. I chose graffiti because it is a commonly reported 311 complaint that may correlate with other neighborhood conditions associated with property crime risk.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load from downloaded CSV file\ngraffiti <- read_csv(\"data/Crimes_-_2017_20251114.csv\") %>%\n  filter(!is.na(Latitude), !is.na(Longitude)) %>%\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"Longitude\", \"Latitude\"), crs = 4326) %>%\n  st_transform('ESRI:102271') %>%\n  distinct()\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Graffiti requests loaded:** 264936 unique locations in 2017\n\n### Visualize Graffiti Distribution\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = chicagoBoundary, fill = \"gray95\", color = \"gray60\") +\n  geom_sf(data = graffiti, color = \"#e76f51\", size = 0.1, alpha = 0.3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Graffiti Removal Requests in Chicago (2017)\",\n    subtitle = paste0(\"n = \", nrow(graffiti), \" requests\")\n  ) +\n  theme_crime()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Assignment4_Spatial_Predictive_Analysis_REVISED_files/figure-html/visualize-graffiti-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Pattern observation:** Graffiti requests also show spatial clustering, with certain neighborhoods showing much higher concentrations of reports. This suggests that graffiti, like burglary, is not randomly distributed but follows spatial patterns tied to neighborhood characteristics.\n\n**What I did:** I loaded Chicago’s boundary and police districts and reprojected all layers into the Illinois State Plane East system to ensure consistent spatial measurement. I then imported and cleaned the 2017 burglary dataset, filtering specifically for forcible-entry incidents and converting them into sf points. I visualized these burglaries using point maps and kernel density estimation to explore their spatial distribution. Finally, I loaded the 2017 graffiti removal requests, removed duplicates, converted them into sf points, and mapped their spatial patterns.\n\n**Why this step is important:** This step prepares all spatial layers in a consistent coordinate system so that later operations—such as fishnet aggregation, distance calculations, and spatial cross-validation—are accurate. Exploring the raw data through maps helps determine whether burglary and graffiti exhibit meaningful spatial structure, which is necessary for constructing a predictive model. Graffiti represents a neighborhood disorder indicator that may explain variation in burglary risk, so confirming its coverage and spatial distribution is essential before building features.\n\n**What I learned:** Both burglary incidents and graffiti requests show strong clustering rather than random dispersion. Burglary hotspots appear along several central and southern corridors, while graffiti requests are dense in many of the same areas. The high volume of graffiti reports provides rich spatial variation when aggregated to grid cells. These patterns confirm that place-based conditions matter and that graffiti is a reasonable predictor for modeling burglary counts. This provides a solid foundation for constructing the fishnet features used in the next step.\n\n## Part 2: Create Fishnet Grid\n\n### Generate Grid\n\nI create a 500m × 500m fishnet grid to aggregate point-level crime data into a regular spatial structure suitable for count regression modeling.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create 500m x 500m grid\nfishnet <- st_make_grid(\n  chicagoBoundary,\n  cellsize = 500,\n  square = TRUE\n) %>%\n  st_sf() %>%\n  mutate(uniqueID = row_number())\n\n# Keep only cells intersecting Chicago\nfishnet <- fishnet[chicagoBoundary, ]\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Grid created:** 2458 cells of 500m × 500m each\n\n### Aggregate Burglaries to Grid\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Spatial join and count burglaries per cell\nburglaries_fishnet <- st_join(burglaries, fishnet, join = st_within) %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  group_by(uniqueID) %>%\n  summarize(countBurglaries = n())\n\n# Join back to fishnet\nfishnet <- fishnet %>%\n  left_join(burglaries_fishnet, by = \"uniqueID\") %>%\n  mutate(countBurglaries = replace_na(countBurglaries, 0))\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Burglary count distribution:**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata.frame(\n  Statistic = names(summary(fishnet$countBurglaries)),\n  Value = as.numeric(summary(fishnet$countBurglaries))\n) %>%\n  mutate(Value = round(Value, 2)) %>%\n  kable() %>%\n  kable_styling()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Statistic </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Value </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Min. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1st Qu. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Median </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2.0 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Mean </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3.3 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 3rd Qu. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5.0 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Max. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 41.0 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Cells with zero burglaries:** 30.3%\n\n### Visualize Aggregated Counts\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = fishnet, aes(fill = countBurglaries), color = NA) +\n  geom_sf(data = chicagoBoundary, fill = NA, color = \"white\", linewidth = 1) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\n    name = \"Burglaries\",\n    option = \"plasma\",\n    trans = \"sqrt\",\n    breaks = c(0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Burglary Counts by Grid Cell\",\n    subtitle = \"500m × 500m cells, Chicago 2017\"\n  ) +\n  theme_crime()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Assignment4_Spatial_Predictive_Analysis_REVISED_files/figure-html/visualize-fishnet-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Distribution characteristics:** Most cells have 0-2 burglaries, with a long right tail showing a few cells with very high counts. This right-skewed distribution is typical of crime data and motivates the use of count regression models (Poisson or Negative Binomial) rather than standard linear regression.\n\n**What I did:** I created a 500m × 500m fishnet grid covering the Chicago boundary and kept only the cells that intersect the city. This produced 2,458 uniform grid cells. I then performed a spatial join to count how many burglary incidents fell within each grid cell and merged these counts back into the fishnet. Finally, I summarized the distribution of burglary counts and mapped the aggregated values to visualize spatial variation at the grid-cell scale.\n\n**Why this step is important:** A fishnet converts point-level crime events into a regular spatial structure, which is essential for predictive modeling. Regression models require each observation to represent a consistent spatial unit, and the grid ensures every cell has the same size and comparable meaning. Aggregating burglaries to grid cells also helps reduce noise in point data, revealing broader spatial patterns. Examining the distribution of counts is necessary for selecting an appropriate modeling approach; crime data typically exhibit overdispersion, which affects whether Poisson or Negative Binomial models are more suitable.\n\n**What I learned:** Spatial aggregation reveals strong variation across the city even after smoothing point data into grid cells. Most grid cells contain between 0 and 2 burglaries, while a smaller number of cells have much higher counts, reaching up to 41 incidents. Roughly 30% of the cells contain zero burglaries, while a few hotspots dominate the upper tail of the distribution. This right-skewed pattern is typical of crime data and confirms the need for count-based models rather than linear models.\nThe map also shows that burglary risk remains spatially clustered even after aggregation, indicating that neighborhood characteristics at the 500m scale are meaningful and appropriate for prediction.\n\n\n## Part 3: Create Kernel Density Baseline\n\nBefore building complex models, I create a simple baseline using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). This baseline asks: \"What if crime just happens where it happened before?\" with simple spatial smoothing and no predictors.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Convert burglaries to point pattern format\nburglaries_ppp <- as.ppp(\n  st_coordinates(burglaries),\n  W = as.owin(st_bbox(chicagoBoundary))\n)\n\n# Calculate KDE with 1km bandwidth\nkde_burglaries <- density.ppp(\n  burglaries_ppp,\n  sigma = 1000,\n  edge = TRUE\n)\n\n# Convert to raster\nkde_raster <- rast(kde_burglaries)\n\n# Extract KDE values to fishnet cells\nfishnet <- fishnet %>%\n  mutate(\n    kde_value = terra::extract(\n      kde_raster,\n      vect(fishnet),\n      fun = mean,\n      na.rm = TRUE\n    )[, 2]\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = fishnet, aes(fill = kde_value), color = NA) +\n  geom_sf(data = chicagoBoundary, fill = NA, color = \"white\", linewidth = 1) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\n    name = \"KDE Value\",\n    option = \"plasma\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Kernel Density Estimation Baseline\",\n    subtitle = \"Simple spatial smoothing of burglary locations\"\n  ) +\n  theme_crime()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Assignment4_Spatial_Predictive_Analysis_REVISED_files/figure-html/visualize-kde-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Baseline interpretation:** The KDE provides a simple prediction surface based purely on past crime locations. The complex model must outperform this baseline to justify its added complexity.\n\n**What I did:** I converted the burglary point locations into a point pattern object and computed a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) surface using a 1 km bandwidth. This produced a smoothed crime-intensity raster that reflects where burglaries have historically concentrated. I then extracted mean KDE values for each fishnet cell, integrating this baseline predictor into the dataset. Finally, I visualized the KDE surface over Chicago to examine the resulting spatial pattern.\n\n**Why this step is important:** KDE provides the simplest possible spatial prediction model: it assumes that future crime is most likely to occur where past crime was concentrated, with smoothing to account for local diffusion. This creates an essential benchmark model. Any more complex predictive model—including those using graffiti or other features—should outperform this KDE baseline to justify the added complexity. KDE also helps capture large-scale spatial trends that might be difficult to learn from sparse count data alone.\n\n**What I learned:** The KDE surface highlights broad, continuous hotspots across Chicago, especially in the central and near-south regions, which aligns with both the raw point distribution and the aggregated burglary counts. Because KDE smooths over local noise, it produces a stable risk surface that looks less fragmented than the fishnet counts. This confirms that burglary risk has strong spatial structure and spatial autocorrelation. It also reinforces the need for models that can capture both local indicator variables (e.g., graffiti) and larger-scale spatial patterns.

I then compared this map with burglary counts to see if the patterns matched. I also calculated how close each cell is to nearby graffiti using k-nearest neighbors. To capture clustering, I ran Local Moran’s I to find “High-High” graffiti hotspots and then measured how far each cell is from the nearest hotspot.\n\n**Why this step is important:** These steps create the predictor variables that the model will use. Graffiti counts show how much disorder is inside each cell, while the distance measures show how close a cell is to surrounding disorder. The hotspot analysis identifies areas where graffiti is unusually concentrated—information that may help explain where burglaries happen.\n\n**What I learned:** Graffiti is highly uneven across the city: some cells have almost none, while others have extremely high counts. Areas with lots of graffiti often overlap with areas of high burglary, which suggests a possible relationship. The nearest-neighbor distances show that most cells are still close to some graffiti activity. The hotspot map highlights several clear clusters of disorder, many in areas that also see more burglary. Overall, these graffiti-based features seem useful for predicting burglary patterns.\n\n## Part 5: Join Police Districts for Cross-Validation\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Join district information to fishnet\nfishnet <- st_join(\n  fishnet,\n  policeDistricts,\n  join = st_within,\n  left = TRUE\n) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(District))\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Districts represented:** 22 police districts\n\n**What I did:** I assigned each grid cell to a police district using a spatial join.\n\n**Why this step is important:** This lets us run spatial cross-validation, where the model is tested on completely different districts instead of random samples.\n\n**What I learned:** Almost all districts are represented in the fishnet, giving enough geographic variety to meaningfully test how well the model generalizes across space.\n\n## Part 6: Model Fitting\n\n### Prepare Modeling Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create clean modeling dataset\nfishnet_model <- fishnet %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  dplyr::select(\n    uniqueID,\n    District,\n    countBurglaries,\n    graffiti_count,\n    graffiti_nn,\n    dist_to_hotspot\n  ) %>%\n  na.omit()\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Modeling dataset:** 1708 observations with 5 variables\n\n### Fit Poisson Regression\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Fit Poisson model\nmodel_poisson <- glm(\n  countBurglaries ~ graffiti_count + graffiti_nn + dist_to_hotspot,\n  data = fishnet_model,\n  family = \"poisson\"\n)\n\nsummary(model_poisson)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = countBurglaries ~ graffiti_count + graffiti_nn + \n    dist_to_hotspot, family = \"poisson\", data = fishnet_model)\n\nCoefficients:\n                    Estimate   Std.

This could indicate missing variables (demographic factors, housing characteristics, or economic conditions) that would help explain variation in these areas.\n\n**What I did:** I generated burglary predictions using the final Negative Binomial model, compared them to a KDE baseline, and mapped the errors.\n\n**Why this step is important:** This reveals how well the model captures the actual spatial pattern of burglaries and whether it improves on a simple hotspot-based baseline.\n\n**What I learned:** The NB model performs slightly better than KDE overall, but both methods struggle in a few neighborhoods, suggesting that adding more predictors could improve accuracy.\n\n## Summary and Conclusions\n\n### Model Performance Summary\n\nThis analysis demonstrates that incorporating graffiti removal requests as a spatial indicator improves burglary prediction beyond a simple kernel density baseline.\n\n**Key findings:**\n\n1.  **Spatial patterns exist:** Both burglaries and graffiti show clear spatial clustering, supporting the hypothesis that neighborhood conditions influence crime patterns.\n\n2.  **Graffiti as an indicator:** The relationship between graffiti and burglaries suggests that visible disorder indicators may correlate with property crime risk, consistent with \"broken windows\" theory.\n\n3.  **Model improvements:** The Negative Binomial model with spatial features outperforms the KDE baseline, with cross-validated MAE = 3.12 burglaries per cell.\n\n4.  **Spatial features matter:** Including not just counts but also proximity measures (k-NN distance) and cluster identification (Local Moran's I) captures different aspects of the spatial relationship between disorder indicators and crime.\n\n### Critical Considerations\n\n**Data limitations:** Both burglary reports and 311 graffiti requests reflect reporting behavior, not just underlying conditions. Areas with more police presence may show more recorded burglaries, while areas with more civic engagement may show more graffiti reports.\n\n**Correlation vs causation:** Finding that graffiti predicts burglaries doesn't mean graffiti causes burglaries. Both may be symptoms of underlying neighborhood conditions like disinvestment, population change, or economic stress.\n\n**Equity concerns:** Predictive models trained on historical data may perpetuate existing biases in policing patterns. Areas that were over-policed in the past will appear as \"high crime\" areas, potentially justifying continued over-policing.\n\n**Model limitations:** The model's prediction errors show spatial patterns, indicating missing important variables. Demographic characteristics, economic conditions, housing quality, and other contextual factors likely play important roles.\n\n### Potential Improvements\n\nFuture analyses could improve on this work by:\n\n-   Adding more predictor variables (demographics, land use, economic indicators)\n-   Testing different grid cell sizes to find optimal aggregation\n-   Comparing multiple 311 violation types to identify which indicators are most predictive\n-   Examining temporal trends to understand how relationships change over time\n-   Conducting equity analyses to understand differential prediction accuracy across neighborhoods\n\n### Final Recommendation\n\nThis model demonstrates technical competence in spatial predictive modeling, but should not be deployed for operational police decision-making without careful consideration of ethical implications. The modest improvements over baseline suggest limited practical utility, while the risk of reinforcing existing inequities in policing is substantial. If used at all, such models should complement rather than replace human judgment, include strong oversight mechanisms, and be regularly audited for disparate impacts across communities.\n",
